- add delay to simulation async application of patches
- add ACK and async support when applying patches
- update notes to document how undo works, and what tiles need to do 
- extract shared model common functions, so when demonstrating this to developers
  I can show how the shared model is super simple
- deal with the dynamic linked models. Use case: tile is added to document, it is 
  then linked with another tile. 
- add state saving and loading
- add async loading to work out how to handle incomplete loads that have
  dependencies
